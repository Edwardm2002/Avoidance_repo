# Avoidance Adventure Game

This is my mini game I have written in C
It needs to be compiled before it is run 
Use the command gcc Avoidance.c -o Avoidance 
Then run using ./Avoidance

The aim of the game is to retrieve the hidden formula which is within an abandoned warehouse.
What the warehouse used to be used for is a mystery and you will find out as the game progresses.

Follow the instructions in game for help.
